# twitterLinkCMS
C# program that takes in an HTML file with Twitter links and replace them with their embeddable code via the Twitter API

Fork this repository into Visual Studio and open it up in your editor. The HTML file is already included in the bin and simply running the problem
will parse the HTML text and replace the twitter links with the proper embedded code. The output is printed to the console.
